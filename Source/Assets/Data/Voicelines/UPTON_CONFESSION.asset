  Subtitle: "Alright man, yeah I dumped his body, but I didn\u2019t kill him. I\u2019m
    just an errand boy. This guy named Luca Verdere paid me five grand to get rid
    of it. He told me to drop the body and come back to the chop shop at 54th Street.
    I swear man, I didn\u2019t kill the guy. Can I go now?\r"
