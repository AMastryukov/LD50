  Subtitle: "The victim\u2019s name is Rico Shade. Ties to organized crime, arrested
    but never charged. Found dead a few hours ago, beaten and then shot, good riddance.
    If you ask me, it\u2019s an open-and-shut case of gang-on-gang violence. This
    case will be closed in a couple days, so don\u2019t delay the inevitable. Just
    note the evidence and come back to the station.\r"
