  Subtitle: "Thank you, detective. I am a man of my word, so here is what you need
    to know. I had to contact you anonymously because my main phone is bugged. As
    you may have guessed, I am a wanted man, so I must stay in the shadows. But I\u2019m
    also no fool, so I know you wouldn\u2019t arrest me, since you can\u2019t even
    trust your own colleagues. Here, take this key. Go back to the apartment, and
    look behind the painting. Everything you need to know is inside. Good luck, detective.\r"
